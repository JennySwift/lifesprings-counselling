    <h1>About Dina</h1>

    <p>I am passionate about helping others grow in their capacity to live life more fully as they grow in
        understanding of themselves, develop stronger relationships and discover healthier ways of dealing with life
        challenges.</p>
    <p>After completing my undergraduate degree, I spent a decade in the finance industry. It was during the years that
        I was raising my family that I discovered my interest in helping others. Through various volunteer roles and
        personal experiences helping those in need, I discovered my genuine interest in coming alongside those
        struggling with life challenges. Eventually this interest led me to training as a professional counsellor.</p>
    <p>Since qualifying as a registered professional counsellor, I have focused on working with individuals (adults)
        and couples. As a trans-theoretical practitioner, I draw from a wide range of therapy interventions in my work
        with clients, including family systems, psychodynamic, cognitive behavioural and imago relationship therapy.</p>
    <p>My multiple cross-cultural experiences from living in different countries have equipped me for working
        sensitively with clients of diverse cultural backgrounds.</p>
