    <h1>Welcome to Lifesprings Counselling!</h1>
    <h2>Dina Lindemann 0414 440 727</h2>

    <p>Perhaps you have come to this site whilst exploring the possibility of counselling for yourself or someone you
        know. Here you will find information on the counselling and psychotherapy service offered at Lifesprings
        Counselling.</p>
    <p>My name is Dina Lindemann, and I am a Christian counsellor, and professional registered counsellor and
        psychotherapist. I specialise in working with individuals and couples seeking counselling from a Christian world
        view.</p>
    <p>Whether working with individuals or couples, I strive to provide a compassionate, non-judgemental and safe
        therapeutic space, in which clients can undertake their own personal journey of positive change. I provide both
        short term counselling as well as longer term counselling based on my clientâ€™s needs.</p>
    <p>Practicing within a Christian worldview, I take a holistic approach in my practice, recognising that physical,
        psychological and spiritual aspects of the individual all contribute to healthy functioning.</p>
    <p>As a registered member of the <a href="http://www.ccaa.net.au/" target="_blank">Christian Counsellors Association of Australia</a> (CCAA), all counselling and therapy
        is conducted abiding by the ethical guidelines of the Association, as well as the ethical standards of the
        <a href="http://www.pacfa.org.au/" target="_blank">Psychotherapy & Counselling Federation of Australia (PACFA)</a>.</p>
